# Artificial Intelligence: Theory and applications

This repository contains the programming exercises and the theory assignments for ECE NTUA course Artificial Intelligence

## First Programming Exercise
The aim of this exercise is to apply search algorithms and find the optimal path in a square grid NxN. <br/>
At the *first part* of this exercise many probabilistic grids were created. Each grid had obstacles, empty spaces, a grid, a starting point and a goal. The obstacle distribution was radom and described by a given probability p. The main goal of this part was to place the obstacles as random as possible. After that you can see the visualization of the final grids for different given p. <br/>
At the *second part* some search algorithms were implemented, more specifically BFS, Best First and A*. Moreover different heuristic functions and strategies were implemented. Hope that you will find my ideas regarding heuristics interesting! <br/>
The final result conclude an video visualization for each step of the algorithm, but these videos could not properly loaded at github <br/>
At the *third part* the different algorithms were compared. This step took a lot of time, and interesting results were concluded. <br/>
