# Artificial Intelligence: Theory and applications

This repository contains the programming exercises and the theory assignments for ECE NTUA course Artificial Intelligence

## First Programming Exercise
The aim of this exercise is to apply search algorithms and find the optimal path in a square grid NxN. <br/>
In the *first part* of this exercise many probabilistic grids were created. Each grid had obstacles, empty spaces, a grid, a starting point and a goal. The obstacle distribution was radom and described by a given probability p. The main goal of this part was to place the obstacles as random as possible.Moreover you can see the visualization of the final grids for different given p. <br/>
In the *second part* some search algorithms were implemented, more specifically BFS, Best First and A*. Moreover different heuristic functions and strategies were implemented. These ideas of heuristics will hopefully be of major interest to you! <br/>
The final results are concluded in visualization videos describing each step of the algorithm, but these videos could not properly loaded at github <br/>
In the *third part* the different algorithms were compared. This step was time consuming but interesting results were concluded. <br/>

## Second Programming Exercise
The aim of this exercise is to create a simple movie recommender system using Prolog. This result would be concluded through the features of the films and the given ratings of other movies for the examine user.  <br/>
In the *first part* of this exercise we examined the dataset and created some simple prolog rules. Some of the rules constructed were to find movies with really close genres, or with enough close genres, find movies with the same plots etc. The final result was described with classes of similarity for each examined movie.
In the *second part* of this exercise we had to combine the rules that we created at the first part in order to create a recommender system. This system will take as input a movie, and will give the 10 best matching movies as output.<br/>
In the *third part* we considered the overall rating of other movies for the examine user. So the recommender system had to overview the user's old preferences and use the existing rules of the second part. <br/>
Questions such as “What is more important: the user’s old preferences or the already knowledge of association between the films?” were solved through many simulations in the given dataset.<br/>
